# Arduino-Serial-LEDs #
This is a simple header with a test implementation in an Arduino sketch to control LEDs. It uses object-oriented-programming with a simple LedString class. Many thanks to [Nick Sevens](http://www.nicksevens.com/) for his Kodi/Serial code!

## Upcoming features: ##
- [x] Implementation of serial to control actions taken by the Arduino
- [x] A [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) addon script to control the Arduino through serial
- [ ] Greater serial functionality
